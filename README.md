# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to reevaluate the analysis without 9th grade grades at Thomas Highschool. Originally we performed the analysis on all students but due to THomas 9th grade data being altered, we reran the data to exclude 9th grade Thomas. Then we analyzed the new resuls for district and school summary and compared it to the previous results.
 

## Results

* How is the district summary affected?
    The district summary is not effected as the code did not ask us to report the new THomas and student count numbers into the district summary. The total students would have     been 38,709 instead of 39170, as 461 student scores were replaced w/NaN.
    
* How is the school summary affected?
    The school summary is effected with new scores from Thomas High SChool. Instead of failing/passing percentages in math, reading, and overall now all scores are passing.         Overall passing math percentage went from 66% to 93%. Reading overall passing rate from 69% to 97%. Ovreall rates went from 65% to 91%. 
    
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
    Replacing reading and math scores for 9th grade Thomas highschools, made all Thomas's average grades and overall passing percentage increase. This put Thomas the second highest performing school whereas Thomas was in the lower half amongst other schools.
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
      * Math and reading scores by grade
          * Thomas Highschool went from 66% overall passing to 95% rate in Math and a 69% to 97% passing rate in reading. Thomas Highschool now is in the top 5 schools with               passing reading and math overall percentages
      * Scores by school spending
          Subbing NaN scores with Thomas 9th grades raised Thomas math and reading scores which increased their overall passing rate. Thomas is in the $630 -$644 bin budget per           student. This increased the entire bin of $630-$644 results. 
      * Scores by school size
          Thomas is ihe midle class size bin. Since Thomas average math and reading percents all increased when removing 9th grade, this also increased stats for the entire               medium school size bin. 
      * Scores by school type
          Thomas is classified as a charter school. Since Thomas overall reading, math and overall percentages all went up, so did the overall charter school percentage.
